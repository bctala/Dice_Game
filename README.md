# Dice Game - Flutter Project

## Overview

The **Dice Game** is an engaging mobile application developed using the Flutter framework. This game challenges players to make predictions about two rolled dice. The unique twist is that players must place their prediction before the dice are rolled. If their prediction matches the outcome, they earn a point. The game also keeps track of the player's maximum score.

## Game Rules

1. **Placing Predictions**: The game begins with the player's prediction phase. The player has two options:
   - Predict "Equal" if they believe the two dice will show the same number (e.g., both dice show 4).
   - Predict "Not Equal" if they believe the two dice will show different numbers (e.g., one die shows 3, and the other shows 6).

2. **Rolling the Dice**: After placing their prediction, the dice will roll. Two random numbers between 1 and 6 are generated.

3. **Checking Predictions**: The game checks whether the player's prediction matches the outcome of the dice roll. If the prediction is correct, the player earns a point, and the game acknowledges their success. If the prediction is incorrect, no points are awarded.

4. **Maximum Points**: The app keeps track of the player's maximum score, so they can aim to beat their own record.

5. **Play Again**: The player can choose to play again by placing a new prediction. The game continues, and the player can keep trying to earn more points.
